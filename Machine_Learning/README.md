#### Filename: Factorydata.ipynb <br>
Context: This is a dataset collected from a manufacturing factory, it contains various information on different machines.<br>
Objective: The factory wants to build a machine learning model to predict whether the machine is working properly or faulty.<br>
Approach: Build various classification models with machine learning algorithms; use regularization (Ridge), hyperparameters tuning (GridSearch) and SMOTE to improve performance <br>

#### Filename: HousingPricing.ipynb <br>
Context: This dataset contains house sale prices for King County. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.<br>
Objective: To build a machine learning model to predict sale prices of houses in King County.<br>
Approach: Build regression models with machine learning algorithms; use regularization (Ridge), tuning of hyper parameters to improve performance. 

#### Filename: PPT_report.md <br>
Context: Report findings on Factorydata and HousingPricing, includes exploratory Data Analysis, model evaluation and recommendation.
Objective: To provide conclusion on which model works best to achieve stated objectives.

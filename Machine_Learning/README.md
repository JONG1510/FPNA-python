Filename: Factorydata.ipynb <br>
Context: This is a dataset collected from a manufacturing factory. The dataset contains various information on different machines. 
Objective: The factory wants to build a machine learning model to predict whether the machine is working properly or faulty.  
Approach: Build various classification models with machine learning algorithms; use regularization (Ridge), hyperparameters tuning (GridSearch) and SMOTE to improve performance <br>
Filename: HousingPricing.ipynb <br>
Context: This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
Objective: To build a machine learning model to predict sale prices of houses in King County. <br>
Approach: Build regression models with machine learning algorithms; use regularization (Ridge), tuning of hyper parameters to improve performance.

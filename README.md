# FPNA-python
### Filename: Factorydata
 ### Purpose: Build a machine learning model to predict whether a machine is working or faulty. <br>
 ### Approach: 
 > 1. Examine features in existing data set and identify critical features used for modelling.
 > 2. Build classification models with machine learning algorithms; use regularization (Ridge), hyperparameters tuning and SMOTE to improve performance. 
 > 3. The output variable is Machine status is working (=0) or faulty (=1). 
 > 4. The model is evaluated on Confusion Matrix.
